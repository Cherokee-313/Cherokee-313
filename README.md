My name is Juan Robinson. I am currently pursuing a career in information and technology. For that reason I am interested in web design due to it central focus on the discipline. I already possess an AA in Liberal Arts but feel like a STEM discipline would serve me better in the fast-paced technological word. Furthermore, I am intent on building my own business and contend that technological proficiency is conducive to success in that arena.
